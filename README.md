## JS practice questions 
### Objects
 + Create an object which will have a date key, 
 
 [SOLUTION]()
### Functions
 + Return the sum of all arguments passed to function.
            Example: f(1,2,3,4) => 24, f(4,7) => 28, f(4) => 4
            
            [SOLUTION]()
 + Create function that will return all the most repeated element.
 
 [SOLUTION]()
 + Let’s say we have an object with linked props (i.e 
let list = {
  value: 1,
  next: {
    value: 2,
    next: {
      value: 3,
      next: {
        value: 4,
        next: null
      }
    }
  }
};
);
Print all the values with recursion.
[SOLUTION]()
 + Reduce, Map…..
 
 [SOLUTION]()
 + Write a function which will remove all repeated items of array.
 
 [SOLUTION]()
 + Write a JavaScript function that checks if the given string includes the given substring.
EX: str = “Hello” substr = “ell” => returned value is true
EX: str = “Kill” substr = “lolo” => returned value is false
[SOLUTION]()
 + Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in the upper case.
EX: ‘i love you’ => ‘I Love You’, (use str.split function)
[SOLUTION]()
 + Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string.
Example string : 'Web Development Tutorial'
Expected Output : 'Development'
Extra Exercise 1
[SOLUTION]()
 + Write a JS function, which will work as a calculator.
It will accept 3 arguments, first number, second number and the sign
EX:
calc(1, 2, ‘+’) =>3 
calc(1, 2, ‘-’) =>-1
calc(1, 2, ‘*’) =>2
calc(1, 2, ‘/’) =>½
